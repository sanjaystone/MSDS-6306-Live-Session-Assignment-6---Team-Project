MSDS 6306 Live Session Assignment 6 Project in R-Studio-Property Sales

Cynthia Alvarado, Sanjay Kalluvilayil, Arnold Zhang

This is the MSDS 6306 session 6 assignment.
The goal is to create an RStudio project in GitHub, with repository, directory, readme, and analysis.

This team is working with the Bronx housing sales dataset.

The R code will take in the csv file, preview the data, and clean and format the data. 
In particular, it will make names lowercase, remove leading digits, and provide initial exploration. 
The code will remove outliers that seem erroneous.
